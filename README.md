# Pokédex

This project demonstrates my skills in JavaScript, web development, and API integration. The app fetches random Pokémon data from the Pokedex API and displays details such as height, weight, and a Pokémon image on the screen. This project showcases my ability to work with external APIs, handle asynchronous operations, and create dynamic web pages.

## Features

- Fetches random Pokémon data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
- Displays Pokémon name, height, and weight.
- Dynamically updates the page with Pokémon's image and information.
- Handles errors gracefully when API requests fail.
- Simple and user-friendly UI with interactive button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structuring the content.
- **CSS** for styling the app (light theming and responsive layout).
- **JavaScript** for functionality, including:
  - Asynchronous requests using `async/await`.
  - DOM manipulation to update the page dynamically.
  - Event handling to trigger API calls on button clicks.
